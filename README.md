# 🔥 BaseClean - Zero-Approval Token Burner

The **safest and simplest** way to burn worthless ERC20 tokens from your wallet.

## 🎯 **What Makes BaseClean Revolutionary**

BaseClean is the **first and only token burner** that requires **ZERO approvals** - making it completely secure and user-friendly:

- 🔒 **Zero approvals** = Zero attack surface (no contract permissions ever)
- ⚡ **Direct transfers** = Maximum transparency and simplicity  
- 🛡️ **No smart contracts** = No code dependencies or security risks
- 🎯 **One-click experience** = Select tokens → Click burn → Done!
- 💰 **Cost efficient** = No approval gas fees, just burn transactions

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd baseclean
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
# Connect wallet → Select tokens → Burn them!
```

## 🔒 **How Direct Transfer Works**

### **❌ Traditional Token Burners (Dangerous):**
```
1. Approve contract for Token A (permanent security risk)
2. Approve contract for Token B (permanent security risk)  
3. Approve contract for Token C (permanent security risk)
4. Call batch burn function (complex, can fail)
5. Result: 3 permanent approvals remain (ongoing attack surface)
```

### **✅ BaseClean Direct Transfer (Safe):**
```
1. Transfer Token A to burn address (simple, secure)
2. Transfer Token B to burn address (simple, secure)
3. Transfer Token C to burn address (simple, secure)
4. Result: Tokens burned, zero approvals ever given
```

## 📱 **User Experience**

1. **Connect Wallet** - MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or any Web3 wallet
2. **Auto-Discovery** - App automatically finds all your ERC20 tokens
3. **Smart Selection** - Choose worthless tokens with one click
4. **Preview & Confirm** - See exactly what will happen before burning
5. **One-Click Burn** - Seamless progress with individual token celebrations
6. **Instant Results** - Tokens disappear from wallet immediately

3. **Persistent Agreement** - Agreement is stored locally, only shown once per user
4. **Professional Disclaimer** - Clear explanation of risks and responsibilities

### **📋 Disclaimer Content:**
The disclaimer covers critical points including:
- User responsibility for all burning actions
- Permanent and irreversible nature of token burning
- No liability for mistakes, misclicks, or technical errors
- Explicit release of BaseClean and developers from claims
- Emphasis on careful review before transactions

### **🔧 Development & Testing:**

```bash
# Reset disclaimer during development:
# 1. Open browser console (F12)
# 2. Run: resetDisclaimer()
# 3. Refresh page to see disclaimer again

# OR clear localStorage manually:
# localStorage.removeItem('baseClean_disclaimer_agreed')
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- `src/components/DisclaimerModal.tsx` - Modal component with disclaimer content
- `src/hooks/useDisclaimer.ts` - State management for disclaimer display
- `src/utils/disclaimer.ts` - Utility functions for disclaimer persistence
- Automatically integrated into `src/pages/_app.tsx` for global coverage

## 🎯 **Perfect Use Cases**

### **🗑️ Token Cleanup:**
- **Airdrop tokens** you don't want (SPAM, worthless drops)
- **Meme coins** that went to zero (DOGE variants, etc.)
- **Test tokens** cluttering your wallet (development artifacts)
- **Scam tokens** you want to remove (suspicious airdrops)
- **Duplicates** or unwanted forks

### **🛡️ Security Benefits:**
- **Eliminate attack surface** from worthless token approvals
- **Clean wallet interface** for better usability
- **Reduce gas costs** from approval transactions
- **Prevent accidental interactions** with scam tokens
- **Maintain wallet hygiene** for professional use

## 💡 **Why Choose BaseClean?**

### **🔒 Security First:**

```

### **💰 Cost Efficient:**
- **No approval gas fees** - Save 50%+ on gas costs
- **Predictable costs** - Know exactly what you'll pay
- **No failed batch transactions** - Each token burns independently
- **No wasted approvals** - Never pay for unused permissions
