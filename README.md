# 🔥 BaseClean

A Web3 application for burning unwanted ERC-20 tokens and NFTs on Base network without requiring token approvals.

## 🎯 What is BaseClean?

BaseClean allows users to permanently remove unwanted tokens from their wallets by transferring them directly to a burn address (`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`). Unlike traditional token burners that require users to approve smart contracts, BaseClean uses direct wallet transfers.

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ **NFT Support**: Supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens on Base and Zora networks
- 🛡️ **Spam Detection**: Smart filters to identify low-value and suspicious tokens
- ⚡ **Instant Updates**: Burned assets disappear from your wallet immediately
- 📊 **Transaction History**: Keep track of all your burn transactions
