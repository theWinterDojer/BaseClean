# BaseClean

A Web3 application for burning unwanted ERC-20 tokens and NFTs on Base network without requiring token approvals.

## What is BaseClean?

BaseClean allows users to permanently remove unwanted tokens from their wallets by transferring them directly to the burn address (`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`). 

## Features

- **Token Discovery**: Automatically scans your wallet for ERC-20 tokens
- **NFT Support**: Supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens on Base and Zora networks
- **Spam Detection**: Smart filters to identify low-value and suspicious tokens
- **Instant Updates**: Burned assets disappear from your wallet immediately
- **Transaction History**: Keep track of all your burn transactions (with CSV exports)
- **Zero Approvals**: No token approvals ever required - maximum security
- **Privacy-First**: All data stored locally in your browser (no external tracking)
- **Open Source**: Complete transparency for security review and audit

## Why Zero Approvals Matter

**BaseClean Direct Transfer:**
- Direct wallet-to-burn-address transfers (no intermediary contracts)
- Zero token approvals ever required
- Each transaction is independent and transparent  
- Real-time balance verification prevents invalid amount errors
- Maximum wallet compatibility with automatic gas estimation

**Traditional Approval Method:**
- Approve smart contract for each token
- Creates permanent approval attack surface
- Complex batch transactions that can fail
- Ongoing security vulnerabilities
