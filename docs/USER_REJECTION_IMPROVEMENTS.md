# Wallet Rejection Error Handling Improvements

## Overview

This update adds comprehensive error handling for wallet rejections and other transaction errors in the BaseClean token burning functionality. The error you encountered (`ContractFunctionExecutionError: User rejected the request`) will now be handled gracefully with user-friendly messaging.

## What Was Added

### 1. Error Handling Utilities (`src/utils/errorHandling.ts`)

- **Error Classification**: Automatically categorizes errors into types:
  - `USER_REJECTED` - User cancelled transaction in wallet
  - `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` - Not enough gas or tokens
  - `NETWORK_ERROR` - Connection issues
  - `CONTRACT_ERROR` - Smart contract issues
  - `TIMEOUT` - Transaction timeouts
  - `UNKNOWN` - Other errors

- **User-Friendly Messages**: Converts technical errors into readable messages
- **Detection Functions**: Accurately identifies user rejections vs actual failures

### 2. Enhanced Burn Flow (`src/hooks/useBurnFlow.ts`)

- **User Rejection Tracking**: Separate counter for cancelled vs failed transactions
- **Better Status Messages**: Context-aware completion messages
- **Graceful Handling**: No more scary error messages for wallet cancellations

### 3. Improved UI (`src/features/token-scanning/components/BurnTransactionStatus.tsx`)

- **Visual Separation**: User cancellations displayed separately from failures
- **Color Coding**: 
  - üü¢ Green for successful burns
  - üü° Yellow for user cancellations 
  - üî¥ Red for actual failures
- **Helpful Messaging**: Clear explanations of what happened

### 4. Updated Direct Burner (`src/lib/directBurner.ts`)

- **Enhanced Error Parsing**: All errors now parsed and categorized
- **User Rejection Detection**: Identifies when user cancelled vs system failure
- **Detailed Results**: Results include error type and user-friendly messages

## Will This Happen in Production?

**Yes, user rejections will occur in production.** This is normal behavior when:
- Users change their mind and cancel transactions
- Users accidentally trigger a transaction
- Users want to adjust gas settings
- Wallet security prompts users to review carefully

## How It's Now Handled

### Before (The Error You Saw):
```
ContractFunctionExecutionError: User rejected the request.
Request Arguments:
  from:  0xfC84BE4721Ab9BA28bfC421CEF450F4839D4CDB8
  [... technical details ...]
```

### After (User-Friendly):
```
‚è≠Ô∏è Transaction was cancelled. You can try again when ready.
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **No More Technical Errors**: Users see friendly messages instead of stack traces
2. **Clear Categories**: Users understand the difference between:
   - ‚úÖ Successfully burned tokens
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Transactions they cancelled  
   - ‚ùå Actual system failures
3. **Helpful Guidance**: Users know they can try again for cancellations
4. **Progress Tracking**: Shows which specific tokens were cancelled vs burned

## Example Scenarios

### All Transactions Cancelled:
> ‚è≠Ô∏è All transactions were cancelled. You can try again anytime.

### Mixed Results:
> üéâ Successfully burned 3 tokens! (2 cancelled by user)

### Only Cancellations:
> ‚ö†Ô∏è 5 transactions cancelled. Please try again when ready.

## Development Testing

A demo component (`ErrorHandlingDemo.tsx`) is available to test different error scenarios during development.

## Technical Details

The error handling checks for these rejection patterns:
- "user rejected"
- "user denied" 
- "user cancelled"
- "rejected by user"
- "denied by user"

All variations are caught and handled appropriately, ensuring users get consistent, friendly feedback regardless of their wallet type or browser.
