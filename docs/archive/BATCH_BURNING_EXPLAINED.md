# 🔥 Batch Burning Transaction Flow Explained

**Understanding what happens when you burn tokens with BaseClean**

---

## 🎯 **Why Multiple Transactions?**

When you burn multiple tokens using BaseClean, you'll need to sign **multiple transactions**. This is normal and expected! Here's why:

### **The Two-Step Process:**

1. **🔐 Step 1: Approval Transactions** (1 per token)
   - **What:** Give permission to the BatchBurner contract to spend your tokens
   - **Why:** Required by ERC20 token standard for security
   - **How many:** One transaction per token type

2. **🔥 Step 2: Batch Burn Transaction** (1 total)
   - **What:** Actually burn all approved tokens in one transaction
   - **Why:** Saves gas compared to burning individually
   - **How many:** Just one transaction for all tokens

---

## 📝 **Example: Burning 3 Tokens**

If you select 3 different tokens to burn, you'll sign **4 transactions total:**

### **Approval Phase (3 transactions):**
```
Transaction 1: Approve SPAM Token → Allow BatchBurner to spend your SPAM
Transaction 2: Approve SCAM Token → Allow BatchBurner to spend your SCAM  
Transaction 3: Approve JUNK Token → Allow BatchBurner to spend your JUNK
```

### **Burn Phase (1 transaction):**
```
Transaction 4: Batch Burn → Burn all 3 tokens at once
```

---

## 🔍 **What You'll See in Your Wallet**

### **During Approval Transactions:**
- **To:** `0x[TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS]` (each token's contract)
- **Function:** `approve`
- **Parameters:** BatchBurner address + token amount
- **Gas:** ~50,000-80,000 gas per approval

### **During Batch Burn Transaction:**
- **To:** `0x[BATCHBURNER_CONTRACT]` (BatchBurner contract)
- **Function:** `batchBurnERC20`
- **Parameters:** Array of token addresses + amounts
- **Gas:** ~150,000-300,000 gas (scales with token count)

## 💡 **Clear Status Messages**

BaseClean now shows you exactly what's happening:

### **Step 1: Approving Tokens**
```
🔐 Step 1 of 2: Approving 3 tokens for burning

💡 You need to approve each token individually before batch burning
Approvals completed: 2 of 3
⏳ Please approve the transaction in your wallet
```

### **Step 2: Batch Burning**
```
🔥 Step 2 of 2: Burning 3 tokens in one transaction

🔥 Now burning all 3 tokens in one transaction
⏳ Please confirm the batch burn transaction in your wallet
```

### **Completion**
```
✅ Successfully burned 3 tokens!

Tokens have been sent to the burn address (0x000...dEaD)

## 🚀 **Why Batch Burning is Better**

### **❌ Old Way (Individual Burns):**
- 3 tokens = 3 separate burn transactions
- Higher total gas costs
- More wallet confirmations
- Tokens burned individually

### **✅ New Way (Batch Burning):**
- 3 tokens = 3 approvals + 1 batch burn
- Lower total gas costs
- One final burn transaction
- All tokens burned together atomically

---

## 🛡️ **Security & Safety**

### **Approval Safety:**
- ✅ You only approve the exact amount being burned
- ✅ Approvals are specific to the BatchBurner contract
- ✅ No unlimited approvals - only what you're burning
- ✅ Contract is verified on BaseScan

### **Burn Safety:**
- ✅ Tokens go to dead address: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`
- ✅ Transaction is atomic - all tokens burn together or none do
- ✅ No one can access burned tokens (not even us!)
- ✅ Process is transparent on blockchain

## 🧪 **Testing on Base Sepolia**

When testing on testnet, you'll see:

- **Network:** Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532)
- **Explorer:** https://sepolia.basescan.org
- **Contract:** Verified BatchBurner contract
- **Same flow:** Approvals → Batch burn

The exact same process works on mainnet!

## ❓ **Common Questions**

### **Q: Why can't I approve all tokens at once?**
**A:** Each ERC20 token is a separate smart contract. You must interact with each contract individually to grant approval. This is an Ethereum standard, not a BaseClean limitation.

### **Q: What if I cancel during approvals?**
**A:** No problem! Already-approved tokens stay approved, but the batch burn won't happen. You can restart the process anytime.

### **Q: Can I approve more than I'm burning?**
**A:** BaseClean only requests approval for the exact amount being burned. This is safer than unlimited approvals.

### **Q: What if the batch burn fails?**
**A:** Your tokens remain in your wallet with approvals still active. You can try the batch burn again without re-approving.

### **Q: How do I know it worked?**
**A:** Check the burn address on BaseScan: https://basescan.org/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD
