## 🧹 Documentation Maintenance

Historical development documentation has been removed to keep the repository focused on current, production-relevant information. The documentation structure prioritizes:

## 🎯 Documentation Philosophy

BaseClean documentation focuses on:
- **Production deployment** - How to host and maintain the service
- **Technical architecture** - How the zero-approval system works
- **Performance optimization** - Gas costs and efficiency considerations

Since BaseClean is a hosted application, end-user documentation is integrated directly into the app interface rather than maintained as separate files.

## 🔄 Maintenance

Documentation is maintained to reflect:
- ✅ Current production architecture (zero-approval burns)
- ✅ Hosting and deployment requirements  
- ✅ Security best practices and threat detection
- ✅ Performance characteristics and optimizations

The repository maintains only current, production-relevant documentation to ensure clarity and focus for users and developers.
