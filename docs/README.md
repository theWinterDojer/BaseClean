# 📚 BaseClean Documentation

Technical documentation for BaseClean - a hosted Web3 application for burning unwanted tokens and NFTs.

## 🌐 About BaseClean

BaseClean is a **production SaaS application** hosted at `baseclean.io`. Users access the app directly through their web browser to clean their wallets safely with zero token approvals required.

## 📋 Available Documentation

| File | Purpose | Audience |
|------|---------|----------|
| `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` | 🚀 Production deployment instructions | DevOps/Infrastructure |
| `GAS_OPTIMIZATION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` | ⛽ Technical gas analysis and optimization strategies | Developers/Technical |

## 📦 Archive

The `archive/` directory contains historical documentation from the development process, including:
- Development guides and testing instructions
- Historical implementation discussions
- Legacy architectural decisions
- Old user guides for self-hosted setups

These files are preserved for reference but are not relevant to the current hosted SaaS implementation.

## 🎯 Documentation Philosophy

BaseClean documentation focuses on:
- **Production deployment** - How to host and maintain the service
- **Technical architecture** - How the zero-approval system works
- **Performance optimization** - Gas costs and efficiency considerations

Since BaseClean is a hosted application, end-user documentation is integrated directly into the app interface rather than maintained as separate files.

## 🔄 Maintenance

Documentation is updated to reflect:
- ✅ Current production architecture (zero-approval burns)
- ✅ Hosting and deployment requirements
- ✅ Security best practices
- ✅ Performance characteristics

Legacy development documentation is archived rather than deleted for historical reference.
