# User Rejection Error Fix

## Problem
You were getting this scary error when rejecting token burn transactions from your wallet:

```
ContractFunctionExecutionError: User rejected the request.

Request Arguments:
  from:  0xfC84BE4721Ab9BA28bfC421CEF450F4839D4CDB8
  to:    0x2c001233ed5e731b98b15b30267f78c7560b71f2
  data:  0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dead0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008ac7230489e80000
  gas:   100000
```

## Root Cause
The error was being logged by the `console.error` statement in `directBurner.ts` even though it was properly caught and handled. User rejections are **normal behavior** but were being treated as actual errors.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Error Detection** (`utils/errorHandling.ts`)
Added better detection for `ContractFunctionExecutionError` patterns:
```typescript
// Now catches these patterns:
- "ContractFunctionExecutionError: User rejected the request"
- "user rejected the request" 
- Plus all existing patterns
```

### 2. **Intelligent Logging** (`lib/directBurner.ts`)
Changed from always logging errors to smart logging:
```typescript
// Before: Always logged as error
console.error(`Error burning token ${token.contract_address}:`, err);

// After: Only log actual errors, not user rejections
if (!isRejection) {
  console.error(`Error burning token ${token.contract_address}:`, err);
} else {
  console.log(`User cancelled burn transaction for token ${token.contract_address}`);
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Promise Rejection Handler** (`pages/_app.tsx`)
Made the global handler more aggressive about suppressing user rejection errors:
```typescript
// Now specifically catches ContractFunctionExecutionError with user rejection
(errorString.includes('contractfunctionexecutionerror') && errorString.includes('user rejected'))
```

### 4. **Additional Safety Layer** (`lib/directBurner.ts`)
Added immediate error detection at the `writeContractAsync` call level to catch rejections as early as possible.

## Result

### Before:
❌ Technical error messages in console  
❌ Scary stack traces for normal user behavior  
❌ No distinction between user cancellations and actual failures  

### After:
✅ User rejections handled silently or with minimal logging  
✅ Clear distinction between cancellations and actual errors  
✅ User-friendly messages in UI  
✅ No scary technical errors for normal behavior  

## User Experience

When users reject a transaction now:
- **In Production**: Silent handling, user-friendly UI message
- **In Development**: Minimal console.log for debugging
- **In UI**: Clear message like "Transaction was cancelled. You can try again when ready."

## Testing

A test component (`ErrorHandlingTest.tsx`) has been created to verify the fix works correctly. You can temporarily add it to any page to test that user rejections are handled gracefully.

## Important Notes

- **User rejections will still happen** - this is normal wallet behavior
- **They're now handled gracefully** - no more scary error messages
- **UI still shows appropriate feedback** - users understand what happened
- **Actual errors are still logged** - only user rejections are treated differently

The fix ensures that when users click "Reject" in their wallet, it's treated as normal user behavior rather than an application error.
