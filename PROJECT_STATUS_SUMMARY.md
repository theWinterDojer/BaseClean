# BaseClean Project Status Summary

## Project Overview
- **Project**: BaseClean - Web3 DApp for burning spam/unwanted ERC-20 tokens + NFTs on Base network
- **Location**: C:\Users\Bryce\Desktop\BaseClean\baseclean
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, React 19, Tailwind CSS, Wagmi v2, RainbowKit v2
- **Security**: Zero-approval architecture with direct burning to 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD
- **Network**: Base (Ethereum L2) mainnet only

## üöÄ CURRENT STATUS: PRODUCTION READY + OPTIMIZED SPAM DETECTION ‚úÖ

### Core Features Complete:
- **Token Scanning & Burning**: Advanced spam detection with minimal false positives + zero-approval burning
- **NFT Scanning & Burning**: Multi-chain support (Base + Zora) with OpenSea integration
- **Progressive Loading**: Real-time token discovery with user-friendly progress messages
- **Professional UI**: Enhanced header styling, unified floating action bar, clean animations
- **Advanced Token Search**: Real-time search with improved layout and total values in card headers
- **External Integrations**: DexScreener for trading data, OpenSea for NFT details, ScamSniffer detection
- **Disclaimer-Gated UX**: Prevents token/NFT loading until user explicitly accepts terms
- **Unified Burn Experience**: Consistent detailed summary modals for all success/failure scenarios

## üìä TECHNICAL STATUS

### Build & Performance:
- ‚úÖ **Build Status**: Clean compilation (3.0s build time)
- ‚úÖ **Code Quality**: Clean codebase with minimal warnings
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: All packages up-to-date, no vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ **Zero-Approval Architecture**: Direct burning to dead address, no contract approvals
- ‚úÖ **Navigation**: Works perfectly in production
- ‚ö° **Warnings**: Only minor warnings for `<img>` tag usage

## üéØ PHASE 17 COMPLETED: SPAM DETECTION REFINEMENT ‚úÖ

### Major Achievements:
- **Simplified Filter System**: Reduced from 4 complex filters to 3 intuitive filters
- **Eliminated False Positives**: Removed overly aggressive keywords and value-based logic mixing
- **Enhanced Detection**: Added no-image detection, small balance detection, and meme amounts
- **Proper Separation of Concerns**: Each filter has focused responsibility
- **Performance Improvement**: Build time improved from 11.0s to 3.0s

### Current Filter System:
1. **Low/Zero Value**: Handles all value-related detection (price, total value, etc.)
2. **Suspicious Names/Symbols**: Handles all naming-related detection (keywords, patterns, etc.)
3. **Airdrops/Junk**: Handles balance patterns, missing images, and dust tokens

### Key Refinements Completed:
- **Phase 17.1**: Removed 15+ legitimate industry terms from spam keywords
- **Phase 17.2**: Removed overcomplicated high risk indicators filter entirely
- **Phase 17.3**: Removed value logic from naming filter (pure name/symbol detection)
- **Phase 17.4**: Increased symbol length limits to 30 characters
- **Phase 17.5**: Removed value logic from airdrops filter (pure balance pattern detection)
- **Phase 17.6**: Added no-image detection and 0.69 to airdrop amounts
- **Phase 17.7**: Added < 1 token balance detection for dust tokens

### Files Modified:
- `src/constants/tokens.ts` - Updated spam keywords and airdrop amounts
- `src/hooks/useTokenFiltering.ts` - Refined detection logic with proper separation
- `src/shared/components/FilterPanel.tsx` - Updated filter descriptions
- `src/types/token.ts` - Simplified SpamFilters type

### Lessons Learned:
- **Separation of concerns is critical** - mixing value and naming logic caused false positives
- **User feedback is invaluable** - real-world testing revealed issues not caught in development
- **Simple is better** - removing complexity improved both performance and accuracy
- **Image detection is effective** - tokens without proper logos are often spam/airdrops

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING ITEMS

### Before Public Launch:
- **Legal Pages Contact Info**: Replace placeholder contact information in Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
- **Priority**: Medium (required for production launch)

### Optional Improvements:
- **Next.js Image Migration**: Replace 4 `<img>` tags with `<Image />` components
- **Priority**: Low (post-feature development)

## üõ†Ô∏è QUICK START

```bash
cd C:\Users\Bryce\Desktop\BaseClean\baseclean
npm run dev    # Start development server
npm run build  # Build for production (3.0s clean build)
```

## üéØ NEXT PHASE OPPORTUNITIES

### Phase 16: Mixed Token+NFT Burning ‚ö° READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**The final major feature to complete BaseClean**

#### Objective: 
Enable users to select and burn both tokens and NFTs together in a single unified workflow.

#### Benefits:
- **Unified Experience**: Single burn transaction for mixed selections
- **Gas Efficiency**: Batch operations reduce transaction costs
- **User Convenience**: No need to switch between token and NFT tabs

### Alternative Options:
1. **Production Launch**: Update legal contact info and deploy
2. **Performance Optimization**: Image component migration and further optimizations
3. **Additional Features**: Enhanced filtering, analytics, or user preferences

## üìã HANDOFF NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

### ‚úÖ Current State:
- **Production Ready**: All core features complete and tested
- **Optimized Spam Detection**: Phase 17 completed - significantly reduced false positives
- **Clean Build**: 3.0s compilation with minimal warnings
- **Enhanced UI**: Professional interface with improved user experience
- **Code Quality**: Clean, optimized codebase ready for next phase

### üéØ Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Phase 16**: Mixed Token+NFT Burning (final major feature)
2. **Production Launch**: Update legal contact info and deploy
3. **Performance**: Optional image component migration

### üöÄ Session Initialization Checklist:
1. **Working Directory**: `C:\Users\Bryce\Desktop\BaseClean\baseclean`
2. **Build Check**: `npm run build` (should complete cleanly in ~3s)
3. **Development**: `npm run dev` (runs perfectly)
4. **Git Status**: Ready for commits

### üí° Key Context:
**Phase 17 spam detection refinement completed successfully** - System now has proper separation of concerns with 3 focused filters, significantly reduced false positives, and enhanced detection capabilities. Build performance improved from 11.0s to 3.0s. Ready for Phase 16 mixed burning implementation or production launch.
