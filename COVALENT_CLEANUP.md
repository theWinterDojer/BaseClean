# Covalent API Cleanup Guide

## ✅ **What Was Removed**

We've successfully removed all Covalent API dependencies from BaseClean:

- ❌ **Covalent API calls** - No longer needed
- ❌ **Covalent fallback logic** - Simplified to Alchemy-only
- ❌ **Covalent types** - Cleaned up TypeScript definitions
- ❌ **Complex multi-provider logic** - Streamlined codebase

## 🎯 **Recent Update: CoinGecko Removal**

We've also removed CoinGecko to eliminate rate limiting issues:

- ❌ **CoinGecko API route** - Deleted `/api/token-price.ts`
- ❌ **CoinGecko price fetching** - No more 429 rate limit errors
- ❌ **Complex price fallback logic** - Simplified to DeFiLlama only

## 🎯 **Current Setup (Fully Simplified)**

### **Primary Provider: Alchemy**
- ✅ Fast, reliable token discovery
- ✅ Generous free tier (100M compute units/month)
- ✅ Native Base network support
- ✅ No CORS issues

### **Price Source: DeFiLlama Only**
- ✅ **No rate limits** - Completely free
- ✅ **Excellent Base coverage** - Purpose-built for DeFi
- ✅ **More reliable** - Better for DeFi tokens than CoinGecko
- ✅ **Faster** - No complex fallback logic

## 🔧 **Environment Configuration**

### **Required:**
```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_key_here
```

### **No Longer Needed:**
```bash
# These can be removed from .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_COVALENT_API_KEY=xxx  # ❌ Remove this
NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_API_KEY=xxx  # ❌ Remove this
```

## 🚀 **Benefits of This Cleanup**

- **🎯 Simpler codebase** - Less complexity, easier to maintain
- **💰 Cost effective** - Alchemy + DeFiLlama both free
- **🚀 Better performance** - Single API sources, faster responses
- **🔒 More reliable** - No rate limiting or API key dependencies
- **🛠️ Future-proof** - Based on industry-leading infrastructure
- **✅ No more 500 errors** - Eliminated CoinGecko rate limits

## 🔍 **How to Verify It's Working**

1. **Check browser console** for:
   ```
   ✅ "Using Alchemy API for token discovery..."
   ✅ "Found X tokens via Alchemy"
   ❌ No CoinGecko or Covalent references
   ❌ No 500 errors from /api/token-price
   ```

2. **Connect wallet** and scan for tokens
3. **Token discovery** should work normally
4. **Price data** should appear from DeFiLlama only

## 📝 **Next Steps**

1. **Remove old env vars** from your `.env.local`
2. **Keep only** `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY`
3. **Your app is now fully optimized!** 🎉

The BaseClean DApp is now running on the cleanest, most reliable architecture with no rate limiting issues and maximum simplicity.
