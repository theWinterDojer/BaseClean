# BaseClean Refactoring Notes

## Overview
This document outlines the high-priority refactoring improvements implemented to enhance code maintainability, reduce complexity, and improve separation of concerns.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Extracted Burn Flow Logic (`useBurnFlow` Hook)
**Location**: `src/hooks/useBurnFlow.ts`

**Purpose**: Consolidates all burn-related state management and operations into a single, reusable hook.

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates duplicate burn status state management
- Centralizes burn flow logic for better maintainability
- Provides consistent API for burn operations across components
- Improves testability by isolating burn logic

**Key Features**:
- Consolidated `BurnFlowStatus` type combining all burn-related state
- Handles confirmation modal state, simulation, and execution
- Automatically manages token list refresh after successful burns
- Provides callbacks for external state updates (selected tokens, token list)

### 2. Token Selection Management (`TokenSelectionManager` Component)
**Location**: `src/features/token-scanning/components/TokenSelectionManager.tsx`

**Purpose**: Encapsulates all token selection logic and bulk actions into a focused component.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces complexity in main TokenScanner component
- Makes selection logic reusable
- Clear separation of concerns between selection and other operations
- Easier to test selection functionality in isolation

**Features**:
- Individual token selection/deselection
- Bulk operations (select all spam, deselect all)
- Integrates SelectedTokensPanel and BulkActions components
- Clean callback-based API for parent communication

### 3. Token Data Management (`TokenDataManager` Component)
**Location**: `src/features/token-scanning/components/TokenDataManager.tsx`

**Purpose**: Handles all token data fetching, loading states, and error handling.

**Benefits**:
- Separates data concerns from UI logic
- Centralizes loading and error states
- Provides consistent error handling and loading UX
- Uses render props pattern for flexible composition

**Features**:
- Automatic token fetching when wallet connects
- Loading state management with spinner
- Error state display with accessible error messages
- Client-side hydration handling
- External token update support for post-burn refreshes

### 4. Refactored Main Component (`TokenScanner`)
**Before**: 315 lines with mixed concerns
**After**: ~120 lines focused on orchestration

**Improvements**:
- Removed duplicate state management
- Extracted complex logic into dedicated hooks and components
- Cleaner, more readable component structure
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain and extend

### 5. Enhanced Token Image Loading (`api.ts` & `TokenCard.tsx`)
**Location**: `src/lib/api.ts`, `src/shared/components/TokenCard.tsx`

**Purpose**: Significantly improve token image loading success rates and user experience.

**Problem Addressed**:
- Very few token images were appearing despite tokens having images in other wallets
- Limited source coverage (only 2 sources were being tried)
- Aggressive spam filtering preventing legitimate tokens from loading images
- No retry mechanism for failed image loads

**Improvements Made**:

#### Enhanced API Sources (`api.ts`)
- **Increased source coverage**: Now tries 4 reliable sources instead of 2
- **Added new sources**: 
  - DeFi Llama API with Base chain ID (8453)
  - Web3Icons CDN for comprehensive token coverage
  - CoinGecko API with proper JSON handling
  - Moralis Token API
- **Improved timeout handling**: Increased from 300ms to 800ms for better network compatibility
- **Enhanced content type checking**: Validates that responses are actually images
- **More conservative spam filtering**: Only blocks high-confidence spam terms
- **Better error handling**: Improved logging and graceful fallbacks

#### Enhanced UI Component (`TokenCard.tsx`)
- **Retry mechanism**: Automatically retries failed image loads up to 2 times
- **Better error handling**: Distinguishes between loading errors and final fallbacks
- **SVG fallback support**: Properly displays generated SVG fallbacks
- **Loading states**: Improved loading spinner with proper background
- **Placeholder support**: Added blur placeholder for smoother loading experience

#### Updated Token Sources Priority:
1. **Zapper API** - Most reliable for Base tokens
2. **DeFi Llama (Chain-specific)** - `https://icons.llama.fi/icons/tokens/8453/{address}`
3. **DeFi Llama (Legacy)** - Fallback format
4. **Web3Icons CDN** - Comprehensive token coverage
5. **Base Chain Explorer** - Official Base blockchain explorer
6. **CoinGecko API** - With proper JSON parsing
7. **1inch Token Repository** - Community maintained
8. **Moralis Token API** - Additional coverage
9. **TrustWallet Assets** - GitHub-based assets

**Expected Results**:
- Significantly higher image loading success rates
- Faster loading times with better timeout management
- Better user experience with retry logic and proper loading states
- More images showing for legitimate tokens
- Improved fallback handling for when images truly aren't available

**Testing**:
A test component `TokenImageTest.tsx` was created to verify improvements and can be temporarily added to test the new image loading logic.

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
Each component and hook now has a clear, focused responsibility:
- `TokenDataManager`: Data fetching and state management
- `TokenSelectionManager`: Selection logic and bulk actions
- `useBurnFlow`: Burn operation orchestration
- `TokenScanner`: High-level coordination and UI composition

### 2. **Improved Testability**
- Burn logic can be tested independently via `useBurnFlow`
- Selection logic isolated in `TokenSelectionManager`
- Data fetching logic contained in `TokenDataManager`
- Token image loading can be tested with `TokenImageTest` component
- Each piece can be unit tested without complex mocking

### 3. **Better Code Reusability**
- `useBurnFlow` can be reused in other components that need burn functionality
- `TokenSelectionManager` is reusable for any token selection scenario
- `TokenDataManager` provides a consistent data loading pattern
- Enhanced image loading logic benefits all token displays

### 4. **Reduced Complexity**
- Main component is no longer a "god component"
- Each piece handles one aspect of the application
- Easier to onboard new developers
- Reduced cognitive load when making changes

## File Structure Impact

```

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- None - All public APIs remain the same
- External components using TokenScanner see no changes

### Internal Changes
- `TokenScanner` no longer directly manages burn status state
- Burn confirmation and execution logic moved to `useBurnFlow`
- Token fetching logic moved to `TokenDataManager`
- Selection logic moved to `TokenSelectionManager`
- Token image loading significantly enhanced with more sources and retry logic

## Future Improvement Opportunities

With this foundation in place, future improvements become easier:

1. **State Management**: Could easily integrate Zustand/Jotai if state becomes more complex
2. **Error Boundaries**: `TokenDataManager` provides a good spot for error boundary integration
3. **Performance**: Individual components can be optimized/memoized independently
4. **Testing**: Each piece can have comprehensive unit tests
5. **Feature Extensions**: New burn features can extend `useBurnFlow` without touching UI components
6. **Image Optimization**: Could add WebP support, lazy loading, or CDN optimization
7. **Offline Support**: Token image caching could be extended for offline functionality

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Made
- Eliminated duplicate state updates
- Consolidated burn status management
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders through better state organization
- Improved token image loading with better caching and faster sources
- Added retry mechanism to reduce user-perceived loading failures

### Potential Future Optimizations
- Memoization of expensive filtering operations
- Virtual scrolling optimization in `TokenListsContainer`
- Debounced filter updates
- Service Worker for token image caching
- Progressive image loading strategies

## Conclusion

This refactoring significantly improves the maintainability and extensibility of the BaseClean project while preserving all existing functionality. The codebase is now more modular, testable, and easier to understand. The enhanced token image loading should provide a much better user experience with significantly more token images appearing successfully.
