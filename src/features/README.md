# Features Directory

This directory organizes components by feature rather than by type, following a domain-driven design approach.

## Purpose
- Group related components, hooks, and utilities by feature
- Encapsulate functionality in a modular way
- Enable better code organization for feature teams

## Structure
Each feature should be in its own directory, containing:
- Components specific to the feature
- Feature-specific hooks
- Feature-specific types
- Feature-specific utilities

## Example Features
- token-scanning
- wallet-connection
- token-burning
