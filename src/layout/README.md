# Layout Directory

This directory contains layout components that define the structure of the application.

## Purpose
- Reusable layout components like headers, footers, and page layouts
- Container components that manage the overall structure
- Navigation components

## Best Practices
- Keep layouts focused on structure, not business logic
- Make layouts responsive and accessible
- Separate concerns: layout structure vs. component content
