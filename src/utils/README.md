# Utils Directory

This directory contains utility functions and helpers that are used across the application.

## Purpose
- Pure utility functions
- Helper methods
- Reusable logic that isn't specific to React components
- Format converters, validators, and transformers

## Best Practices
- Keep functions pure when possible
- Write tests for utility functions
- Document complex utilities
- Organize into related files (e.g., date-utils.ts, format-utils.ts)
