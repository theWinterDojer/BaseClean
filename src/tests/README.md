# Tests Directory

This directory contains test files for components, hooks, and utilities.

## Purpose
- Store unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests
- Mock implementations for testing
- Test utilities and helpers
- Test fixtures and data

## Structure
- Tests should mirror the source directory structure
- Test files should be named `*.test.tsx` or `*.spec.tsx`

## Best Practices
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Aim for good coverage of core features
- Use Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API mocking
- Set up test utilities for common testing patterns
- Include both unit and integration tests
